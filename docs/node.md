## Board

In NodeKit, the Board is defined as a 768 px x 768 px region on the Participant's screen, in CSS logical pixels. The exact viewing geometry of the Participant is not known. Under the assumptions that:
* * One CSS logical pixel rendered on the Participant's screen corresponds to 1/96 physical inches (see W3's [reference pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel))
* The Participant is sitting roughly arm's length (~28") from their monitor, and viewing it straight on and centered,

The Board would be 8" x 8" physical inches, and take up ~16.26° x 16.26° of the Participant's visual field.
