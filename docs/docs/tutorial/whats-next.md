This tutorial showcased the core concepts of NodeKit: the **Node** and the **Graph**. Most of the code one will write when using NodeKit concerns the creation of Nodes and Graphs.
We wrote a fairly simple Graph in this tutorial, but more is possible:

- Stimuli involving **images or video**, or **combinations thereof**
- More ActionSets, like the **WaitSensor**, **SliderSensor**, **SelectSensor**, and **TextEntrySensor**.
- Describing logic like **performance-gated blocks** using Graph Registers
- Building a **website you can deploy to Mechanical Turk** from a Graph
