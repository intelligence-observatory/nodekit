# NodeKit: a Python library for behavioral tasks 

NodeKit is a Python library for writing behavioral tasks. Any task written using NodeKit can be run in the browser (for people) or in Python (for models).

## Why NodeKit?

- **No HTML/JavaScript/CSS.** Instead, write tasks with Python.
- **Run fair behavioral comparisons between humans and models.**
- **A task is fully defined in one data structure that serializes to plain JSON**.
 

## Why not NodeKit?

- **No HTML/JavaScript/CSS.** Unlimited visual customizability and arbitrary logic is not accessible in NodeKit.
- **No audio.** NodeKit focuses on purely visual tasks.
- **Fixed layout philosophy.** NodeKit describes deterministic, pixel-for-pixel layouts that do not react to window resizing or device type.
