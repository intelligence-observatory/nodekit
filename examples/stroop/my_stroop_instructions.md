## Welcome!
In this task, you will see words that are names of colors ("RED", "GREEN", "BLUE", "YELLOW").

Your job is to identify the **color of the text** as quickly and accurately as possible.
Do **not** read the word itself; instead, focus on the color in which the word is displayed.

- Press the **R** key if the text is red.
- Press the **G** key if the text is green.
- Press the **B** key if the text is blue.
- Press the **Y** key if the text is yellow.

Try to respond as quickly as you can, but make sure to be accurate.
Press the **spacebar** to begin each trial.

You will have a maximum of 5 seconds to respond to each stimulus. If you do not respond within this time, the trial will be marked as "Too slow!".

Good luck!
